Code for running the Monte-Carlo simulations is contained inside this folder.  The code make use of the java library at

https://github.com/robbymckilliam/pubsim

A build of this library is contained in the ./lib folder. There are two scripts for running the simulations

montecarlo.scala

which using the Scala (http://www.scala-lang.org/)  programming language and

montecarlo.m

which uses Matlab.  

The script runsim.sh will run the simulations using Scala.  You need Scala2.10.x installed (this doesn't as default in Ubuntu/Debian yet.  You need to download it from the website).

My version of Matlab comes with Java1.6 installed by default, but Java1.7 is required.  To ammend this install a Java1.7 JRE and point Matlab to it using the instructions at

For me this just involved defining the enviroment variable

MATLAB_JAVA="/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre"
